# Indonesian and Local Languages List of Bad Word for Username

## What is this repository objective?
In short, to list all bad word that need to be censored (as username) version.

We believe there are need to censor or prevent the use of bad word, especially in "all age" targetted platform such as game, digital forums, broadcast stream, etc.
We tried to list not only formal Indonesian words but also local languages and slangs by making a simple quitionaire.

Why username? We believe that some word listed here might not inherently bad, but using it as a username for context might resulting the decrease of user experience as it might become insulting/downgrading others.

## What does not included
- The code implementation to filter out the problematic words. Feel free to make your own implementation and refer the list to this repository.
- The meaning of each word in the word_list.txt file; as in we want to make it simple so other developer could use it without the need to process it first.
- The variations of word using character swap (using numbers as characters; ie: 4 as A/a etc.).

## Contribution
We believe that this initial submition is far from complete and perfect. Therefore contributions is very welcome.
- Provide a new word:
Create issue with the list of words that you think might need to be censored with csv format:
    origin of word (Indonesia/Local/Slang), word, the meaning or why it should be censored or added to the list (to crosscheck so only the bad one listed)
- Make a change/fix

## Feedback
We also open for feedbacks to make this repository better for everyone, feel free by submiting suggestion via issue.
